# MCP servers

Use this reference to find the tools available during an agent diagnosis session. The MCP gateway exposes session-scoped HTTP endpoints. Load their URLs with `agent.utils.mcp_client.load_session_mcp_config`; see [Custom agent integration](custom-agents.md) for a client example.

The [server registry](../../src/nika/mcp/registry.py) selects diagnosis servers from the scenario name, tags, and backend. Every diagnosis session receives `kathara_base_mcp_server`, `pingmesh_mcp_server`, and `packet_capture_mcp_server`. The base server works with Kathara and Containerlab despite its name. The gateway exposes `task_mcp_server` only after the agent advances to submission.

## Run commands on lab nodes

Use `exec_shell(host_name, command, timeout=10)` for ordinary commands. Set `timeout` in seconds when a command such as `kubectl` needs longer. Kathara limits each command result to 4,000 characters, so request bounded output with options such as `--no-headers`, `--tail`, or `-o jsonpath`. Commands run inside the named lab node and remain subject to the session's node access policy.

| Task | Node | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check a route | `router1` | `ip route` or `vtysh -c 'show ip route'` |
| Probe a destination | `pc1` | `ping -c 2 195.11.14.1` |
| Inspect interfaces | `router1` | `ip -s addr` |
| Read a file | `router1` | `cat /etc/frr/frr.conf` |
| Inspect Kubernetes nodes | `controller` | `kubectl get nodes --no-headers` |
| Inspect Kubernetes Pods | `controller` | `kubectl get pods -A --no-headers` |

`exec_shell` is the main tool for targeted checks. The base server also exposes `curl_web_test` for repeated HTTP timing measurements, `iperf_test` for a two-node throughput test, and `active_tcp_probe` for deterministic TCP traffic over a selected five-tuple.

## Use dedicated diagnosis tools

| Server | When selected | Tools and purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pingmesh_mcp_server` | Every diagnosis | `run_pingmesh_snapshot` probes endpoint pairs and reports reachability, loss, and RTT. |
| `packet_capture_mcp_server` | Every diagnosis | `packet_capture_start`, `packet_capture_stop`, and `packet_capture_inspect` collect bounded packet evidence on a node. |
| `kathara_frr_mcp_server` | Kathara scenarios tagged `rpki` | `frr_get_rpki_status` gathers RTR cache state and optional prefix validation evidence. |
| `kathara_iosxr_mcp_server` | Kathara IOS-XR scenarios | `iosxr_exec` runs commands through the XR CLI path. |
| `kathara_routeros_mcp_server` | Kathara RouterOS scenarios | `routeros_exec` reaches RouterOS through its internal management hop. |
| `containerlab_srl_mcp_server` | Containerlab routing scenarios | `srl_exec_cli` runs commands through SR Linux CLI. |
| `kathara_bmv2_mcp_server` | Kathara P4 scenarios | `p4rt_exec` queries P4Runtime through `fabric_mgr` and removes private fault fields from JSON output. |
| `kathara_sdn_mcp_server` | Kathara SDN scenarios | `sdn_onos_rest` queries ONOS REST through `fabric_mgr`. |
| `kathara_telemetry_mcp_server` | Kathara telemetry scenarios | `int_query_telemetry` filters observed INT-MX packet and hop records. |
| `kathara_netflow_mcp_server` | Kathara scenarios named or tagged `netflow` / `ipfix` | `netflow_query` reads IPFIX flow records stored by the lab flow collector. |
| `k8s_mcp_server` | Kubernetes scenarios when `nika.k8s.access` permits MCP | `k8s_list_events` queries session-scoped Kubernetes events. |

### SDN (`kathara_sdn_mcp_server`)

Call `sdn_onos_rest` with paths such as `/onos/v1/devices` or `/onos/v1/flows`. Use `exec_shell` on a switch for `ovs-ofctl` or `ovs-vsctl`, and on `onos` to inspect controller logs.

### P4 / BMv2 (`kathara_bmv2_mcp_server`)

Call `p4rt_exec` with `read` or `read --switch leaf_1`. Its response removes private post-counter fault fields. Use `exec_shell` for ordinary switch commands.

### Telemetry (`kathara_telemetry_mcp_server`)

Call `int_query_telemetry` with a start time and optional flow or packet filters. It reads observed INT-MX traces from the collector. The `p4_dc_gateway` scenario selects this server.

### NetFlow (`kathara_netflow_mcp_server`)

Call `netflow_query` with a time window, e.g. `start_time="-600"` for the last ten minutes. Narrow it with `exporter` (a router name) and an nfdump `filter` such as `proto udp and dst ip 10.254.0.6`. Set `aggregate_by` to sum packets, bytes, and flows per `router`, `inif`, `proto`, `srcip`, `srcport`, `dstip`, or `dstport`. Rows are ordered by `order_by` (`bytes`, `packets`, or `flows`) and capped by `limit` (at most 100).

Routers export only ingress traffic, so a flow appears once for each router on its path. `in_if` is the kernel ifindex of the receiving interface; `ip -o link` on that router maps it to a name. Records become queryable about 20 seconds after the traffic. The `isp_abilene_netflow` scenario selects this server.

### Kubernetes (`k8s_mcp_server`)

Call `k8s_list_events(namespace=..., limit=...)` for event evidence. Use `exec_shell` on `controller` for other Kubernetes operations, such as `kubectl get nodes --no-headers`, `kubectl describe pod ...`, or `kubectl logs ... --tail=20`. Keep output below the command result limit and set a longer timeout for slow API calls. The server is selected when `nika.k8s.access` is `auto` or `mcp`; `kubectl_only` omits it.

## Capture packets

The lab node needs `tshark` for inspection. NIKA images include it. Capture, metadata, and inspection stay inside the target container.

1. Call `packet_capture_start(device, interface, capture_filter=..., max_duration_sec=..., max_packets=...)`. It returns a `capture_id`.
2. Run traffic with `exec_shell`, `active_tcp_probe`, or the scenario's traffic workflow.
3. Call `packet_capture_stop(capture_id)`.
4. Call `packet_capture_inspect(capture_id, view="summary", limit=...)` or use the `packets`, `protocol`, or `expert` view. Pass a Wireshark display filter when needed.

Set bounded duration and packet limits. The capture and metadata remain on the node; the stop result includes the container path.

## Submit a diagnosis

`task_mcp_server` exposes `submit` after `begin_submission_mcp_phase(session_id, diagnosis_report)`. Read `resource_id` and `fault_type` values from the frozen submission context, then call `submit` with `is_anomaly` and `root_causes: [{resource_id, fault_type}, ...]`. The server accepts only catalog IDs. See [Root-cause ground truth and scoring](../benchmarks/root-cause-evaluation.md).
